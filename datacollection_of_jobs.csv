One of the team's main responsibilities is to perform the independent price verification (IPV) process to ensure that valuations reflected in financial statements are in line with accounting requirements and industry best practice.

Valuations assigned to financial instruments play a key role in understanding our portfolio and enabling appropriate decisions to be made. Valuations feed into our accounts, are at the core of P/L, determine the calibration of models, and form a key part of risk assessment. Inaccurate valuations distort the decision making process, and so it is clear that controls ensuring appropriate valuations are an essential part of the firm's operations. To ensure the firm is utilizing appropriate valuations, Swiss Re has developed an IPV process that formally assesses the quality of our valuations and acts to correct any issues.

Role and responsibilities:

This is a newly created role to help the Valuation Risk Management team in preparing the senior management reports and presentations, key risk indicator (KRI) Dashboards and working on other data driven analytical projects.

Innovation will be a key feature of this role. A curious mindset in finding and testing new technics in detecting patterns in data is required. Ability to come up with solutions to loosely defined business problems

Prepare stakeholder reports to simply and effectively communicate IPV results and valuation risk observations. Assist and oversee monthly control and reconciliation processes.

Requirements:

Bachelors in a quantitative discipline, e.g. Applied Mathematics, Engineering, Physics, Computer Science or similar. Those with data science certifications or Masters degree would be preferred,

1-3 years experience in producing detailed analysis reports on demand basis with tight deadlines and clearly communicating the result to senior management.

Candidates with exposure to data visualization techniques in analyzing the large data sets to come up with the signals/trends helpful in better understanding the market direction/deviations

Good understanding & hands-on experience with machine learning and statistics. Strong experience in advanced analytics platforms such as Python & R, Power BI/other analytical tools. Good command of MS Excel including Pivot tables and VBA is must.

Basic understanding of the independent price verification (IPV) process to understand how to value financial instruments and determine whether assets are valued correctly or need to be corrected are preferred but not mandatory.

Ability to work in cross-cultural environment and Ready to work with ambiguity

Excellent oral and written communication skills
